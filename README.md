# eevgen
Tool to generate enchanted weapon variants in Skyrim.

## How to use
This tool is an command line app. To use, open a command prompt in the .exe directory and invoke the tool like this:
```
  ./eevgen.exe "C:/Program Files/Steam/steammaps/common/Skyrim/Data" "C:/Program Files/Steam/steammaps/common/Skyrim/Data/Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul.esp"
```

As shown above, you need to pass two arguments to command line tool - path to your Skyrim data folder and path to mod with new enchantments for which you want to generate variants. Tool should track its progress on the console. I think.
